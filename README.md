# Welcome to the git repository of the Machine Learning Committee of SIIM. 

Under the machine-learning umbrella, you will find sub modules of code
committed by individuals who are willing to share their code with SIIM. 
By convention, the Committee is encouraging participants to base their
code on Dockers to make it easy to contribute, download, run and modify

Thanks to Dr. George Shih MD for kicking off this effort with his Docker 
that build the Keras deep learning framework on top of TensorFLow. Each 
code contributor is asked to bundle all relevant documentation to their
Docker in their commit. 

The Documentation folder is reserved for HOWTO's relevant to the entire
project
