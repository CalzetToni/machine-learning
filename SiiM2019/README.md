# SiiM 2019

Purpose:
--
These are the Jupyter notebooks covered on the Machine Learning 1 session at the Denver meeting. To run them you need Jupyter running on your computer. An easy way to do that is to install a Jupyter DOcker. To make things easier, there is a convenient SIIM docker that has Tensorflow / Keras / Jupyterlab provided.

Requirements:
--
## Running on Google COLAB
A very quick way to try out the notebooks on this site is to link them to Google COLAB. To do this you need
to have a Google account of some type (Gmail works). Then, in your Chrome browser (others likely won't work)
enter the following
```
https://colab.research.google.com/github/ImagingInformatics/machine-learning/blob/master/SiiM2019/xxx 
```
where xxx is replaced by "MLcourse_Notebook_1_update.ipynb" or the other notebooks you see on this site


## Running locally
You will need to install the Docker runtime and then a Jupyter enabled Docker. The steps for installing DOcker are here
https://github.com/ImagingInformatics/machine-learning/blob/master/Documentation/HOWTO-1.md

ANd the steps for installing a Jupyter Notebook are located here: https://github.com/ImagingInformatics/machine-learning/tree/master/docker-keras-tensorflow-python3-jupyter

Once completing the above two tasks make sure to come back to this page.

Now that you have the DOcker runtime and the Jupyter notebook runnning, you can get the content for this course here

This project contains 5 notebooks, a folder called "figures" (which is used by notebook xxx) and some extra instructions (e.g. how to get an MD.ai token for pulling data sets)

Instructions:
--
First, follow the instructions under Requirements for installing the DOcker runtime and installing the Jupyter DOcker on your computer. Once that is done pull down the Notebooks in this git folder and save them to the ALL_NOTEBOOKS folder you created in the Requirements section. 
Each notebook is commented with the additional information required to run it once it is pulled into Jupyter  (e.g. if it needs an MDai token to fetch data)
