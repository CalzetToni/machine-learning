These are the Jupyter notebooks covered on the Machine Learning 1 session at the Denver meeting. To run them you need Jupyer running on your compter. An easy way todo that is to install a Jupyter DOcker. 

To make things easier, there is a convenient SIIM docker that has Tensorflow / Keras / Jupyterlab already installed, located here: https://github.com/ImagingInformatics/machine-learning/tree/master/docker-keras-tensorflow-python3-jupyter
