Purpose:

These are the Jupyter notebooks covered on the Machine Learning 1 session at the Denver meeting. To run them you need Jupyer running on your compter. An easy way todo that is to install a Jupyter DOcker. 

To make things easier, there is a convenient SIIM docker that has Tensorflow / Keras / Jupyterlab provided by SiiM

Requirements:
--
You will need to install Docker runtime and then a Jupyeter enabled Docker. The steps for doing tht are located here: https://github.com/ImagingInformatics/machine-learning/tree/master/docker-keras-tensorflow-python3-jupyter

Contents:
--
There are 5 notebooks, a folder called images (which is used by notbeook xxx) and some extra instructions (e.g. how to get an MD.ai token for pulling data sets)

Instructions:
--
First, follow the instructions above for installing the DOcker runting, and then getting the Jupyter DOcker running on your computer. Once that is done pull down the Notbooks in this folder and save them to the ALL_NOTEBOOKS folder you created in step 2. 
Each notebook is commented with the information required to run it once it is pulle into Jupyter
