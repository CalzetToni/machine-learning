Chapter 0
------------------------------------------
SiiM's objectives for the Machine Learning Comm. are described in HOWTO-1
To realize those objective, submitters should strive to make their
effrots accessable to both newbies and experienced practitionaers

Chapter 1
-----------------------------------------------------
At a minimum, contributors should have a github repository for their own code
that they make public. 

SiiM staff will then use that repo as the source to make a submodule in the 
  http://github.com/ImagingInformatics/machine-learning 

repository. Submitters will always maintain control over thier own work.
....



Chapter 2
---------------------------------------------
Submitters should assume that other users are not intimately famliaer with their
work. Given that, a basic theory of operations for their Docker would be helpful. 

In addition, submitters shoud make clear any hardware (or other) requirements 
that their DOcker needs to enable other users to assess if they have what is
needed to run the DOcker. 

Submitters should also point users to any needed image sets to train or run their
Docker. At present SiiM has very limited avaiklablity of annotated and curated image
sets



Chapter 3
-------------------------------------------
Finally, if submitters would like to maximize their audience they should
link their code to a DOckerHub site to prebuild their DOckers for user


Chapter 4
