HOWTO 2 of the  Machine Learning Comittee of SIIM. 

Intended Audience:
People who have already setup a Docker runtime engine and
have an account on DockerHub, and have run a turnkey ML
DOcker

 Table of Contents
-------------------------------------
Chapter 0: Background
Chapter 1: Installing git and getting a Github account
Chapter 2: Cloning a git repository
Chapter 3: Modifyuing the code on your local branch
Chapter 4: Submitting the code back to the repo owner


Chapter 0
------------------------------------------
In HOWTO-1 you learned how to take a turnkey ML Docker 
and run it on your syste. Now, we assume you want to make 
improvements/changes to it. To do this, you will need the source code
used to build the Docker by the original authors

Enter git ...


Chapter 1
-----------------------------------------------------
Most people in the open source community use a site called Github
to share their code with others. This requires the authors to have
git running locally on their PC, and to have an acount on Github to post
their code for others to see and get

	LINKS to install GIT and get github acct
....



Chapter 2
---------------------------------------------
In HOWTO-1 you grabbed a Docker that was already built and
pulled it onto your PC to run. But once you ahve a github account 
and git running locally, you can download the source code for a DOcker 
and build it yourself. This also means you can modify it 

In HOWTO-1 we went to a site where Dr. S had his pre-built Docker (dockerhub). The linked
source code used to build it here is here
	LINKS to keras source

This is how you clone that source and build it ....



Chapter 3
-------------------------------------------
Let's modifyy the source ...



Chapter 4
-----------------------------------------
And now that you've made massive improvements to Dr. S code
you of course want to submit it back to him to update his repo
