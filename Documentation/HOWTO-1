HOWTO 1 of the  Machine Learning Comittee of SIIM. 

Intended Audience:
People who are brand new to machine learning, and don't
want to acquire a Ph.D. in computer science just to start
learning

-------------------------------------
Chapter 0: Background
Chapter 1: Do you have the required hardware?
Chapter 2: Getting and installing DOcker
Chapter 3: Getting an account on DOckerhub
Chapter 4: Getting a tunrkey Machine Leaning DOcker to run
Chapter 5: building and launching your DOcker


Chapter 0
------------------------------------------
SiiM estalished the Machine Learnign COmmotee to accomplish 
several goals:
	a) teach concepts to people new to the area
	b) encourage learning and modifying from existing turnkey appliances
	c) advance the field with teams of people who are willing to co-develop on reprodcuable platforms

Towwards these ends, the Comm. has settled on the idea of encouraging participants to contribute their 
code in teh reproducable format known as Dockers


Chapter 1
-----------------------------------------------------
Since we ar doing machine learning, and most ML platforms require a
GPU, the first thing to figure out is does your computer have the 
hardware called out by the Docker author that you intend to use?

For the purpose of this HOWTO, we will assume the user is going to 
pull down and run the DOcker based on Dr. George Shui's Keras based
DOcker. 

....



Chapter 2
---------------------------------------------
Again, for the purpose of this HOWTO, we are going to use the 
Keras DOcker that already has an entry on DOckerhub. So all you
have to do is have the DOcker run-time engine, and a DOckerhub
account, to pull down the premade Docker and run it

First, let's install the Docker engine for your PC
