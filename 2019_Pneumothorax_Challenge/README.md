# 2019 SIIM-ACR Pneumothorax Segmentation Challenge

## Outline

Pneumothorax is usually diagnosed by a radiologist on a chest x-ray, and can sometimes be very difficult to confirm. An accurate AI algorithm to detect pneumothorax would be useful in a lot of clinical scenarios. AI could be used to triage chest radiographs for priority interpretation, or to provide a more confident diagnosis for non-radiologists.

## Objective

In this competition, participants developed a model to classify (and if present, segment) pneumothorax from a set of chest radiographic images. This could aid in the early recognition of pneumothoraces and save lives.
